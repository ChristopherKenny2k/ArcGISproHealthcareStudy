# ArcGISpro Healthcare Insurance & Hospital Study (United States)
### Christopher Kenny

### Description
This project investigates the geographical distribution of health insurance coverage disparities across the United States. It analyses the relationship between county-level and state-level insurance statistics with geospatial hospital data. Through ArcGISpro, I conducted an extensive study merging geospatial hospital data and insurance statistics across the United States. My aim was to determine whether the lack of health insurance coverage is predominantly a county-wide or state-wide issue. I enhanced hospital data by integrating the number of rooms in each facility, enabling more detailed analysis. Through ArcGIS, I generated visually compelling maps to illustrate the geographical distribution and magnitude of the health insurance coverage disparity.

### Key Objectives
- Determine the predominant level (county-wide or state-wide) at which lack of health insurance coverage is an issue.
- Enhance hospital data by incorporating the number of beds per facility for more granular analysis.
- Generate compelling maps using ArcGIS to visually represent the geographical distribution and severity of health insurance coverage disparity.

### Software Used:
ArcGIS Pro

### Data Sources:

Geospatial hospital data (Open Data Soft, US Hospital Records)
Insurance statistics by county and state (The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluaiton [ASPE])
Hospital specific room data (Kansas Hospital Association [KHA])

### Project Outputs:

This repository will contain the source code used for data analysis and map generation in ArcGIS Pro.
Visualisations depicting the geographical distribution and severity of health insurance coverage disparity.

### Closing remarks
This project lays the groundwork for further exploration of the relationship between health insurance coverage and hospital availability. 

Potential areas for future investigation include:
  - Analysing the impact of insurance coverage on hospital bed occupancy rates.
  - Exploring the correlations between insurance coverage and specific medical procedures           performed at different hospitals.
